# RNG
This is the Random Number Generator (RNG) that is used within my applications.  It is a collection of different methods
of generating a random number. Everytime a number is generated, it will randomly select which of these methods are used;
and then generate the random number using the selected method.

The following methods are in use:
- [Microsoft Random Class](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.random)
- [Microsoft RNGCryptoServiceProvider Class](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.rngcryptoserviceprovider)
- [Microsoft RandomNumberGenerator Class](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.randomnumbergenerator)

At the core, the random number generated is of type long. This provides a maximum random number from
-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.  Different data types are generated by
converting to the long data type, generating the number, then converting back to the original data type.

The following data types are able to be randomly generated:
- bool/System.Boolean	=> Structured data type that can only be "true" or "false"
- byte/System.Byte		=> Unsigned 8-bit integer (Range: 0 to 255)
- sbyte/System.SByte	=> Signed 8-bit integer (Range: -128 to 127)
- int/System.Int32		=> Signed 32-bit integer (Range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
- uint/System.Int32		=> Unsigned 32-bit integer (Range: 0 to 4,294,967,295)

## Microsoft Random Class
The Microsoft Random Class is based on a modified version of Donald E. Knuth's subtractive random number generator
algorithm. The chosen numbers are not completely random because a mathematical algorithm is used to select them,
but they are sufficiently random for practical purposes.

### Pros
- This can be used for just about any data type, including strings and arrays.
- The implementation of different data types are built into the class.

### Cons
- The numbers generated are relatively easy to predict.
- Using the same seed will generate the same sequence of numbers.

## Microsoft RNGCryptoServiceProvider Class
The Microsoft RNGCryptoServiceProvider Class implements a cryptographic Random Number Generator (RNG) using the
implementation provided by the cryptographic service provider (CSP).

NOTES:
- As of .NET 6, this has become obsolete.  Microsoft suggests using the class RandomNumberGenerator.

### Pros
- The output is cryptographically strong random values.

### Cons
- The random generator only generates bytes, so the different data types need to be built to accomidate how the
  data is stored.  For example, to generate a random integer, an array of 4 bytes need to be used instead of 1.

- Additional functionality needs to be created to handle a fairly generated number.  A fair selection is considered
  to be from a full sequence of values.

For example:
If the number of selections is 6, every 6th selection would represent a new sequence:
- 1 = 1, 2 = 2, 3 = 3, 4 = 4, 5 = 5, 6 = 6
- 7 = 1, 8 = 2, 9 = 3, 10 = 4, 11 = 5, 12 = 6
- ...
- 252 = 1, 253 = 2, 254 = 3, 255 = 4
A selection of 1 - 12 would be fair because all 6 numbers are potentially available.

If the number selected is 253, this is NOT fair because not all numbers are potentially available, only 1 - 4 are
available.

## Microsoft RandomNumberGenerator Class
The Microsoft RandomNumberGenerator Class implements a cryptographic Random Number Generator (RNG) using the
implementation provided by the cryptographic service provider (CSP).

NOTES:
- As of .NET 6, this has become Microsoft's preferred class for generating random numbers; replacing the 
  RNGCryptoServiceProvider class.

- Functionality and results-wise, this is the same as the RNGCryptoServiceProvider class (see Pros/Cons).  The
  Cryptography used is stronger; and has better handling on more platforms.

### Pros
- The output is cryptographically strong random values.

### Cons
- The random generator only generates bytes, so the different data types need to be built to accomidate how the
  data is stored.  For example, to generate a random integer, an array of 4 bytes need to be used instead of 1.

- Additional functionality needs to be created to handle a fairly generated number.  A fair selection is considered
  to be from a full sequence of values.

For example:
If the number of selections is 6, every 6th selection would represent a new sequence:
- 1 = 1, 2 = 2, 3 = 3, 4 = 4, 5 = 5, 6 = 6
- 7 = 1, 8 = 2, 9 = 3, 10 = 4, 11 = 5, 12 = 6
- ...
- 252 = 1, 253 = 2, 254 = 3, 255 = 4
A selection of 1 - 12 would be fair because all 6 numbers are potentially available.

If the number selected is 253, this is NOT fair because not all numbers are potentially available, only 1 - 4 are
available.
